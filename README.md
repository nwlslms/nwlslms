## ABOUT 🧑🏾‍🎓
Hello 👋👋, my name is Nawwal Salim. I’m currently an active undergraduate student at BINUS University, majoring in Computer Science 🎓.

## FOCUS 🔎
So far, I’ve learned `C++` and `C`, which I’ve used extensively for Competitive Programming on platforms [TLX TOKI](https://tlx.toki.id/). I plan to learn `Python` to sharpen my skills in AI and data processing, and `Java` to strengthen my foundation in software engineering.
